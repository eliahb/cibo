			Learn how to make soft and fluffy American Pancakes from scratch. These cake-like pancakes are perfect drizzled with maple syrup and served with fresh berries. <br><br>

			Well now you can learn how to make AMAZING American-style pancakes from scratch. They’re light and fluffy, while still being thick and hearty. Drenched in maple syrup and served with a handful of fresh raspberries, they’re most definitely my favourite morning treat.<br><br>

			Super simple pancakes with no wild ingredients – in fact you probably have everything you need on hand to make a batch right now. Just sayin.
			<br><br>

			The Griddle Cafe in Los Angeles makes the BEST pancakes. They’re thick but fluffy – and about the size of your head. Ever since I tried them, maybe 6 or 7 years ago now, I have wanted to master making perfect pancakes at home. <br><br>

			Growing up in my house, my dad always liked his pancakes thin. Like really thin. Maybe even verging on a crepe. But not me. Oh no, as a child, I liked my pancakes thick and fat. Like a restaurant would serve them. And I have not changed a bit. <br><br>

			INGREDIENTS <p/>
		<br>
			210 grams (1 and 1/2 cups) plain flour or all purpose flour<br>
			50 grams (1/4 cup) caster sugar or granulated sugar<br>
			2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
			55 grams (1/4 cup) butter, plus extra for cooking<br>
			2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
			2 large eggs<br>
			240 ml (1 cup) full fat or whole milk<br>
			Zest of one lemon, optional<br>
			Fresh raspberries and maple syrup, to serve<br><br>

			<p style="font-weight: 500; font-size: 19px;">
			INSTRUCTIONS <p/>
			<br>
			In a large mixing bowl, sift the flour, sugar and baking powder. Give it a little whisk.<br><br>
			Next, add your butter to a separate mixing bowl and microwave for 20 seconds or so until just melted. Add your vanilla, eggs and milk to your butter mixture and stir to combine. Add fresh lemon zest if using.<br><br>
			Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and gently fold through. The mixture should be nice and thick.<br><br>
			Heat a small frying pan on a medium-low heat, add a little butter to the pan and pour over 3 heaped tablespoons or so of pancake batter.  Heat for 1-2 minutes or until golden brown and then flip.<br><br>
			Heat on the opposite side for about 1 minute or until also golden. Remove from heat and set aside. Repeat with remaining pancake batter and butter.<br><br>
			Serve pancakes immediately with maple syrup and fresh raspberries.
