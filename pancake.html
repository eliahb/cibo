			Ground chuck is a great all-purpose, buy-it-anywhere choice for burgers. But if you want to get ambitious and blend, say, chuck with ground short rib or brisket, we say go for it.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

			MAKES 4 SERVINGS<br> <br>

			Vegetable oil (for pan)
			1 pound ground beef chuck (20% fat)
			Kosher salt
			4 slices American cheese
			4 potato rolls, toasted
			Ketchup, mayonnaise, shredded iceberg lettuce, and dill pickle slices (for serving) <br>

			Preparation <br>

			Step 1  <br>
			Heat a cast-iron griddle or large heavy skillet over medium-high until very hot, about 2 minutes, then lightly brush with vegetable oil. Divide ground beef into 4 equal portions (do not form patties). <br>

			Step 2  <br>
			Working in batches if needed, place portions on griddle and smash flat with a spatula to form 4"-diameter patties (craggy edges are your friend). Season liberally with salt and cook, undisturbed, until outer edges are brown, about 2 minutes. Flip patties, season with salt, and place a slice of cheese on top of each patty. Cook until cheese droops and burgers are medium-rare, about 1 minute.  <br>

			Step 3   <br>
			Serve patties on rolls with ketchup, mayonnaise, lettuce, and pickles. <br>
